A sealed class cannot have any new subclasses added except the ones in the same file.
This is very useful for pattern matching because it means you only need
to worry about the subclasses you already know about.

You get better compiler support as well.
If you match against case classes that inherit from a sealed class,
the compiler will flag missing combinations of patterns with a warning message.
