Scala has only a handful of built-in control structures.

The only control structures are:
`if` `while` `for` `try` `match` 
and function calls. 


The reason Scala has so few is that it has included function literals since its inception.
Instead of accumulating one higher-level control structure after another in the base syntax,
Scala accumulates them in libraries.

One thing you will notice is that almost all of Scalaâ€™s control structures result in some value.

This is the approach taken by functional languages
- programs are viewed as computing a value
- thus the components of a program should also compute values
