### Marking rule:
Only definitions marked implicit are available

### Scope rule:
An inserted implicit conversion must be in scope as a single identifier,
or be associated with the source or target type of the conversion.

### One-at-a-time rule:
Only one implicit is inserted

### Explicits-first rule:
Whenever code type checks as it is written, no implicits are attempted
