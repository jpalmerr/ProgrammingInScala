### Literals

- A literal is a way to write a constant value directly in code

### Operators are methods

```scala
val sum = 1 + 2    // Scala invokes 1.+(2)
```

The main take-aways from this chapter are that operators in Scala are method calls,
and that implicit conversions to rich variants exist for Scalaâ€™s basic types
that add even more useful methods.
